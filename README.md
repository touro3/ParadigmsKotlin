## 📖 Overview

This project is designed to illustrate the following OOP principles in Kotlin:

- **Classes and Objects**: The basic building blocks of OOP.
- **Inheritance**: How one class can inherit features from another.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to treat objects of different classes in a uniform way.
- **Encapsulation**: Keeping the internal state of an object hidden from the outside.
- **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts.
- **Interface Implementation**: Demonstrating how interfaces can define behaviors that classes must implement.
